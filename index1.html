        <h1>Pay-per-click (PPC) advertising</h1>
        <h1>PPC is an online advertising model that allows you to place ads in search engine results for specific keywords. If you’re new to PPC, Google Ads is the best place to start, because it allows you to place ads in Google search results. PPC works on a bidding system in which you select target keywords, then compete with other advertisers to place ads in the search results for those keywords. If your bid is among the highest, you’ll earn placement above organic search results — and if someone clicks, you’ll pay your bid amount. One of the biggest advantages of PPC is that (as the name implies), you only pay when users click on your advertisement. This means you don’t have to worry about wasting your budget on people who aren’t interested in your business or ignore your ads.</h1>
