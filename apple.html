      <h2>We create segments, which are groups of people who share similar characteristics, and use these groups for delivering targeted ads. Information about you may be used to determine which segments you’re assigned to, and thus, which ads you receive. To protect your privacy, targeted ads are delivered only if more than 5,000 people meet the targeting criteria.</h1>
      <h3>We may use information such as the following to assign you to segments:
      <br>*Account Information: Your name, address, age, gender, and devices registered to your Apple ID account.
      <br>*Downloads, Purchases & Subscriptions.
      <br>*Apple News and Stocks.</br>
      *Advertising: Your interactions with ads delivered by Apple’s advertising platform.</h3>
