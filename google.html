      <h2>We never sell your personal information</h1>
      <h3>Your personal information is not for sale. While advertising makes it possible for us to offer products free of charge and helps the websites and apps that partner with us fund their content, we do not sell your personal information to anyone.
        <br>We use your activity on Google – like sites you visit, apps you use, and things you’ve searched for – to deliver better, more helpful experiences across our products, including ads. We never use sensitive information such as health, race, religion or sexual orientation to tailor the ads you see. And we don’t use data from Drive, Gmail and Photos for ads, either.</h3>
